# VOTING-SYSTEM
# 🗳 Voting Eligibility Checker  
 
This is a simple *Python program* 🐍 that checks whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

## 📌 About the Code  
- The program asks the user to *enter their age* 👤.  
- If the age is *18 or below* ❌ → It prints:  
  👉 "You are not eligible to vote"
